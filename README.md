# Aeon-v-0.13.0.0-Wallet-Raspberry-Pi-Zero
			
                                    AEON isn't just a currency.
						                            It's a lifestyle.
		            Decentralized digital currency is slowly becoming a normal part of everyday life. 
Yet everybody's main internet device continues to be their cellphone, a device with a low-powered CPU and limited available storage.



				                    THIS IS A BUILD FROM RASPBERRY PI ZERO

        -------->>>	Latest release: Aletheia (0.13.0.0)

It takes 16 hours to configure and another 16 hours to build it. 

I hope i saved Y time :) 

Enjoy :)
